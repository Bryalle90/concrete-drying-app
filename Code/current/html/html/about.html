			<h4>Plastic Shrinkage Cracks in Concrete</h4>
			<p class="text-justify">
				Plastic shrinkage cracks are fine cracks that occur on the surface of concrete before initial set.  Although 
				Plastic shrinkage cracks may not be structurally detrimental, they are not visually appealing, and will likely impact long term 
				durability of the concrete.  Numerous studies [see ACI 305R, ACI 308R, Hover, NRMCA and Uno] have 
				shown that the potential for plastic shrinkage cracking to occur is a function of the ambient weather 
				conditions, particularly the humidity level and the wind speed, as well as the concrete mix design and 
				fresh concrete temperature.
			</p>
			<p class="text-justify">
				The computer software application here can be used to predict the potential for plastic shrinkage cracks 
				to occur based on the formula discussed by Uno.  Formulas for determining concrete temperature as a 
				function of ambient temperature are based on those discussed by Ramey and Carden.  Weather data is 
				obtained from the U.S. National Weather Service.
